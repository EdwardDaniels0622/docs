# chains connect

MAP Protocol can cover different types of blockchains in a peer-to-peer trustless way. Presently, it has established connections with prominent blockchains such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and even NEARâ€”a Non-EVM chain. 

What sets MAP Protocol apart is its ongoing initiative to broaden its reach, actively seeking to integrate with additional Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) solutions.

 The table below provides an overview of the most recent advancements in chain connectivity, along with their corresponding light client contract addresses.
