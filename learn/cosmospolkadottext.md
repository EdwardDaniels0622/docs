            The relay chain does not support cross-chain between EVM and other heterogeneous chains. EVM and other heterogeneous chains need to modify the in-chain structure to become compatible.
        </td>
        <td>
            MAP Relay Chain expands to all heterogeneous chains proactively by adding other heterogeneous chains’ signatures, hashes, mining, and Merkle proof calculation to the EVM level.

            Require EVM and other heterogeneous chains to embed the SDK to the bottom layer of the blockchain. The SDK contains cross-chain execution and verification programs such as Light-clients, asset and data management system, and cross-chain messengers.
        </td>
        <td>
            Proactively deploy the cross-chain execution and verification components on-chain or inter-chain, including assets and data management, cross-chain messengers, and Light-client for verification by way of smart contracts on-chain or inter-chain programs.

            After embedding the SDK, the modified chains become interconnected with the relay chain, thus forming a cross-chain network.

            Blockchain Mainnet Developers<br/>
            - Relay chain only serves mainnet developers, not Dapp developers.<br/>
            - Cross-chain Dapps can only deploy in cross-chain ecological sub-chains, increasing the difficulty of promotions. <br/> 
            - Take Thorchain as an example. Thorchain is an ecological sub-chain of Cosmos. But Thorchain has to use its self-developed MPC as the cross-chain solution instead of using Cosmos’ cross-chain services. Same situation happens to Terra as well.<br/>
            - No cross-chain Dapps on Polkadot so far.
        </td>
        <td>
            Cross-chain Dapp Developers<br/>
            Native cross-chain applications are developed directly on MAP Relay Chain (EVM).<br/>
            The relay chain should become the assembly for cross-chain assets and data, which Cosmos and Polkadot mistakenly ignored. <br/> 
            Cross-chain Dapps can benefit from a shared cross-chain assets and data pool through the deployment on MAP Relay Chain.

        <td>
            All Chains<br/>
            MAP Relay Chain is compatible and interoperable with all chains by proactively deploying cross-chain communication components on-chain or inter-chain and extending EVM capability with heterogeneous chains'features  through precompiled contracts to facilitate gas-efficient light client construction.
