## Introduction of MAP Protocol

MAP Protocol is the omnichain network for an interoperable Web3 with five main features: **Security-Finality, All-Chain Coverage, Instant Confirmation, Minimum Cost, and Developer-Ready**.

MAP Protocol provides instant confirmation for omnichain transactions and verification finality by light-client, offers SDK and API for low-code deployment, proactively embeds other chains' algorithms as pre-compiled contracts in the EVM layer of MAP Relay Chain, and maintains a cost-efficient network.

Nowadays, general chains, such as Ethereum, Avalanche, Flow, have their own respective territory; and dedicated chains, such as IoTex, NKN, are also thriving. Omnichain network, an infrastructure to connect them all, is the future. Together with worldwide developers, MAP Protocol is the dawn of a new omnichain age.

Developers can easily build their omnichain applications deployed on any chain in just **two steps**:

1. **Build inter-chain messenger.**
2. **Interact with on-chain vault and data through our SDK.**

## Features of MAP Protocol 

### Security-Finality
Guarantee blockchain-level security through an independent self-verification network formed by light clients on every public blockchain.

### All-Chain Coverage
Embed heterogeneous chains' signing and hashing algorithm into the EVM layer of the MAP Relay Chain to ensure seamless communication between all chains.

### Instant Confirmation
Inter-chain communication programs and on-chain smart contracts work together efficiently to ensure that speed is only related to each chain's block time.

### Minimum Cost
MAP Protocol only charge the gas fee of MAP Relay Chain and other related chains with no additional cost.

### Developer-Ready
Through MAPO Service (MOS) deployed on and between public chains, dAPPs can share the liquidity of MOS's Vaults on different chains, and customize the entry threshold and incentive model of inter-chain program: messenger. Alternatively, we can use the MOS open source code to build dAPP-related Omnichain components.
